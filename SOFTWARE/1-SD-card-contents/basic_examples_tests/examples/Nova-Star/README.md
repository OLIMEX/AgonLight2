An original game for the Agon Light 
Written entirely on the Agon Light (Agon Light 2 Olimex Version). It was my intention to write a simple game in order to learn how to properly handle sprites.
There was a steep learning curve but I could see my understanding of the sprite sequence progress as the game went along.
The game was initially written in Mode 1 wiith 24 Alien Jelly's instead of the 12 I ended up with. Switching the game to Mode 2 meant that the sprite positions had to be changed to fit Mode 2 resolution of 320x200. Confusingly the internal resolution of BBC Basic remained the same.
There was a few panic moments when I RENUMBER the .bas file a few time and typed LIST only to see most of my programme gone. (There were numbered lines with blank spaces.
I was able to recover my file through the use of the .bak file.
